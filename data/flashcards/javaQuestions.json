        "question": "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?",
        "answer": "An abstract class in Java can have both abstract and non-abstract methods and can maintain state. An interface can only have abstract methods (until Java 8) and cannot maintain state. Java 8 introduced default methods in interfaces, allowing them to have method implementations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Java achieve memory management?",
        "answer": "Java achieves memory management through the use of a garbage collector, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, freeing up memory that is no longer in use or referenced."
    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the exception handling mechanism in Java.",
        "answer": "Java uses a try-catch-finally block structure for exception handling. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the try block, exceptions are caught in catch blocks, and the finally block contains code that is always executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are Java Collections and how are they used?",
        "answer": "Java Collections are a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects.

    },
    {
        "question": "Describe the differences between Checked and Unchecked exceptions in Java.",
        "answer": "Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time while Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime. Checked exceptions are handled using the try-catch block or declared using the 'throws' keyword. Unchecked exceptions are under RuntimeException and are not forced to be handled."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Java Memory Model?",
        "answer": "The Java Memory Model describes how threads interact through memory and how changes to memory are communicated between threads. It defines the rules for visibility and ordering of read and write operations to variables."
